## Frontend Setup & Run Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

### 1. Create the .env File

- Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the `frontend` folder. You can do this manually or run:
  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  Ensure the variables are set correctly for your environment.

### 2. Install Dependencies

- Open a terminal/console inside the `frontend` folder.
- Run the following command to install all dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### 3. Start the Development Server

- After installation, start the development server with:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

The frontend will start and typically be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
